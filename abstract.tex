This document will detail a code to perform parameter estimation and model selection in targeted
searches for continuous gravitational waves from known pulsars. We will describe the general
workings of the code along with characterising it on simulated data containing both noise and
simulated signals. We will also show how it performs compared to a previous MCMC and grid-based
approach to signal parameter estimation. The appendix details how to run the code in a variety of
cases.
