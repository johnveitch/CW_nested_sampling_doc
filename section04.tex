\subsubsection{Evaluating coherent signals}

We can run the code such that it provides the joint evidence for a signal in multiple detectors, but we can
also run it for individual detectors. This allows us to compare the model that there is a coherent signal
between detectors (as would be expected for a real signal) to the model that the signal is incoherent between
detectors (as you might expect from a detector line artefact). This can be done by comparing the joint
analysis evidence to the sum of the individual detector evidences (i.e.\ the logical {\it or} between
detectors)
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{O}_{\rm coherent} = \frac{\mathcal{Z}_{\rm Joint}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm det}} \mathcal{Z}_{{\rm det}_i}}
\end{equation}
