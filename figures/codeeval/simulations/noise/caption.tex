\label{fig:simnoise_single}
Marginalised one and two-dimensional posterior probability distributions
for the parameters $\{h_0, \cos{\iota}, \psi, \phi_0\}$
produced from the outputs of the nested sampling code \lppen, and the previous
code \lppe, when running on simulated Gaussian noise assumed from the LIGO H1 detector. The \lppe code was run with both an MCMC sampler mode and a grid-based
evaluation mode (shown as the black dashed line).
