\label{fig:ffdot_inj2}
Posterior probability distributions for the recovered parameters of a simulated signal injected into Gaussian
noise for two LIGO detectors (H1 and L1). The search included the parameters $f_0$, $\dot{f}$, and $\alpha$. The
individual injected SNRs were 7.3 and 8.5 for H1 and L1 respectively, with a coherent SNR of 11.2. The black
vertical dashed lines show the true simulated parameter values, whilst the dashed dark purple lines show the
priors.
