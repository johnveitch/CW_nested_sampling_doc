The coherent signal versus incoherent signal {\it or} noise odds ($\mathcal{O}_{{\rm S/I}_{\rm simple}}$ given
in Equation~\ref{eq:cohvincoh2}) plotted against the coherent signal versus noise odds ($\mathcal{O}_{\rm S/N}$ given
in Equation~\ref{eq:sigvsnoise}), for simulated signals injected as if into the two LIGO Hanford and Livingston
detectors. Half the simulations were created with coherent signals between the two detectors (hexagonal-binned histogram
points in the upper plots, and red points in the lower plot), whilst the other half where incoherent between the
two detectors (black points in both plots). The upper plot is a zoomed in version of the lower plot, with hexagonal
histogram bins coloured to show the coherent signal SNR.
