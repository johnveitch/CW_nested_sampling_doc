\label{fig:nest_evs}
The distributions of ratios of evidence values calculated as a function of the number of live points used, based on searches over $h_0$, $\cos{\iota}$,
$\psi$ and $\phi0$ on 500 simulated Gaussian noise realisations for each $N_{\text{live}}$ value. The ratio compares the evidence produced by the
nested sampling algorithm in \lppen to that produced from a grid over the parameter space with \lppe (which we assume is a representation of the
true value). A comparison of the estimated error on the evidence value using the information gain, $H$ (which is $\sim 2.4$ here), with the measured
standard deviation of the distributions is also plotted and agree rather well.
