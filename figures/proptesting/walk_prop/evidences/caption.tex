\label{fig:walkpropevs}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of estimates of the evidence
$Z$ (as returned by our code) compared to the true evidence $Z_{\rm true}$ (as
calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:kldiv}) as a function of the prior range,
or information gain, when using only the ensemble walk proposal
distribution. The different colour plots represent different numbers
of live points used.
